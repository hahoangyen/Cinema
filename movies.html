                        <p>Welcome back, Mr. Wick. Four years after "John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum," director Chad
                            Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have returned to theaters with "John Wick: Chapter 4," a film
                            that
                            was supposed to hit theaters almost two full years ago. It was worth the wait.
                            Stahelski and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch have distilled the mythology-heavy
                            approach
                            of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a
                            final
                            hour here that stands among the best of the genre.

                        <p>“Shazam! Fury of the Gods” arrives with two strikes against it since it’s not only a
                            studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a
                            certain
                            level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels
                            about
                            the surprisingly decent “Shazam!”. The makers of that fine-enough 2019
                            franchise-starter,
                            including director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and
                            post-Spielberg sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style
                            super-projects that dominate the landscape.

                        <p>The introductions to “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” at the SXSW Film
                            Festival
                            emphasized that they “made this movie for everyone.” There’s clearly a concern that
                            the
                            film may not reach outside the demographic of people who once played or still play
                            the
                            wildly influential role-playing game. And there should be because branding can be a
                            double-edged sword. On the one hand, it targets a massive fan base already familiar
                            with
                            an IP. On the other hand, a film has to be good enough to break out of that
                            familiarity
                            to reach a wider audience—think of how well “The Last of Us” is playing to viewers
                            who
                            never played the game. So how will fans of Dungeons & Dragons respond to this
                            expensive
                            foray into their favorite fantasy experience? Paramount is rolling a 20-sided die
                            and
                            hoping to get the right number, but the fickle Dungeon Master of Hollywood may have
                            a
                            fatal surprise around the next corner.

                            also something that always foils him. His latest, “Knock at the Cabin,” uses the
                            question of human behavior during the threat of end times to create a morality study
                            that progressively hollows itself out. It’s another minor work from a director whose
                            films, especially after “After Earth,” have been mostly major.

                        <p>Was I a little too harsh on 2019’s “Murder Mystery” or do I just like Adam Sandler
                            more now? Both could be true, but it’s indicative of how much comedy can be based on
                            timing and what's going on in the real world. Coming off a spate of mediocre (to be
                            kind) comedies that emerged from his initial deal with Netflix, I gave the
                            comedy/thriller a modest two stars, but now I think it deserves another half-star as
                            a solid diversion. And that could be because of the goodwill engendered by projects
                            like “Uncut Gems,” “Hustle,” and even the relatively enjoyable “Hubie Halloween.” Or
                            I could have just been in a worse mood four years ago. Whatever the reason, “Murder
                            Mystery 2” gets the job done in much the same way. Once again, Sandler’s charm is
                            the strength. Once again, the relatively tight runtime (this one is only 90) keeps
                            The Sandman and his writers away from the meandering non-jokes that fatten the worst
                            Happy Madison movies. And, once again, it’s an easy way to tune out the real world
                            for a feature runtime. Maybe it’s just that we need that more in the 2020s than we
                            did pre-pandemic? It's a mystery.

                    <p>While working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers—and brothers—Mario and Luigi are
                        transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers
                        are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.<span id="dots">..</span>

                    <span id="more">
                        <p>Mario has come a long way since the notoriously awful 1993 version of his adventure starring
                            Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, but the new “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” doesn’t reflect
                            the franchise's creativity in the slightest. The latest animated blockbuster from
                            Illumination is their most soulless to date, a film that feels like ChatGPT produced it
                            after data and imagery from the games were fed into a computer. It is “The Chris Farley
                            Show” of family entertainment, mistaking making references to something that was “awesome”
                            for actually making a movie. And it is one of the most drenched-in-desperation animated
                            films I’ve ever seen. “Remember this?!? Remember how much you liked it?!? Please like it
                            again!” I so desperately wanted to see something that sparked the imagination of the kid in
                            me, like that first game, or spoke to the fun I’ve had playing installments across multiple
                            Nintendo platforms. Instead, I got a movie that's as hollow as a trailer, something that
                            willfully avoids anything creative or ambitious. Mario and Luigi deserve so much better.
